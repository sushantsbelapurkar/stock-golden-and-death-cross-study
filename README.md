# stock market-golden-and-death-cross-study
In the stock market, the golden and death cross is a famous theory. The theory says, when Golden or Death cross occurs, there is a significant stock price movement happens for a specific period. Using fifty years of historical stock price data of nearly 8000 symbols, we have analyzed this cross theory to examine the facts.

##### Steps involved:
- find all stocks that are currently below their 200 days moving average
 - find all stocks that are currently above their 200
- Calculate the 50 DMA and see how it relates to the 200 DMA. 
- Check for the correlation between the two and the direction a stock moves.
- Find all ‘golden crosses’ and all the 'death crosses'
- Find the percentage of those golden crosses result in a price increase by more than 1% to 20% over a period of a week to six months.
- Check whether analytics support the hypothesis of a golden cross or death cross

##### Result
- Golden and death cross hypothesis is to be reject as we cannot find the strong evidence of it, but we found some interesting findings.
